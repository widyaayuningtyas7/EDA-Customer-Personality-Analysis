# EDA-Customer-Personality-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis for Marketing Campaign
## Introduction
This repository is my excercise to implementing Exploratory Data Analysis in Python. Customer personality analysis can help a company to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments.
##  Objective

* Which product purchased the most by group of customers?
* Which places are getting the most purchase?

## Restriction

* Not using data in category promotion as it is irrelevant to objective

## Methodology
* Descriptive Analysis
* Sum Analysis

## Included Packages
* Pandas
* Numpy

## Expected Outcome
* Most purchased products by category
* Most visited store

## Recommendation

1. Maximizing sales and promoting products such as wines, meat and gold **OR** making more deals for other products and getting more sales for it
2. Maximizing sales and promoting more in store as most purchases are coming from store **OR** making more deals for buying from website and catalog
3. Find product price for more precise analysis
