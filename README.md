# EDA-Customer-Personality-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis for Marketing Campaign
## Introduction
This repository is my excercise to implementing Exploratory Data Analysis in Python. Customer personality analysis can help a company to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments.
##  Objective

* Which product purchased the most by group of customers?
* Which places are getting the most purchase?

## Restriction

* Not using data in category promotion as it is irrelevant to objective

## Methodology
* Descriptive Analysis
* Sum Analysis

## Included Packages
* Pandas
* Numpy

## Expected Outcome
* Most purchased products by category
* Most visited store

## Recommendation

1. Maximizing promoting wines for adult category and higher income, then promoting meat for old category and lower income
2. Maximizing sales and promoting more in store as most purchases are coming from store.
